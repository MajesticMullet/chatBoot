# chatBoot

How to write a chat bot?? This is motivated by me wanting to talk to myself when I was in year 10. Ideally I would train my chatbot on my conversations in 2013. First, I need to understand the theory and what I even need to do.

### Goal ###
Write a chatbot that has learnt off my FaceBook messaging data. If this yeilds sensitive information, write a scraper to scrape things off twitter (?) - however this may pose issues as twitter is not a conversation but rather random posts. 

- Learn how to write a chatbot
- Implement it

Finish date: 17/2/2021 (Week 1 of Uni 2021)


# Notes

wit.ai seems like a good option seeing as it is developed by FaceBook and since I'll be using my FaceBook data - I will not have to worry about some third party using possibly sensitive data.
