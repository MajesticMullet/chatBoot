# chatBoot

How to write a chat bot?? This is motivated by me wanting to talk to myself when I was in year 10. Ideally I would train my chatbot on my conversations in 2013. First, I need to understand the theory and what I even need to do.

### Goal ###
Write a chatbot that has learnt off my FaceBook messaging data. If this yeilds sensitive information, write a scraper to scrape things off twitter (?) - however this may pose issues as twitter is not a conversation but rather random posts. 

- Learn how to write a chatbot
- Implement it

Finish date: 17/2/2021 (Week 1 of Uni 2021)


# Notes

wit.ai seems like a good option seeing as it is developed by FaceBook and since I'll be using my FaceBook data - I will not have to worry about some third party using possibly sensitive data. Upon further investigation, this seems boring. There is a nice web interface and it seems like you just click buttons.
I want something that requires more coding.

Chatbots can be categorised into two types:
1. Rule based - when you train a chatbot to answer questions based on a set of predetermiend rules on which it was trained. These fail with more complicated queries and requests.
2. Self learning - learn on their own. These can be futher categorised into retrieval based or generative. 

Rule based seems more suitable for my requirements.
